MrTarget v1
=====================================================================
Copyright (C) 2014 Lock of War, Developmental (Pty) Ltd

Mist of Pandaria Version 5.4.8 (18414)

VERSION 2 on the way, including ARENA build.

MrTarget provides advanced opponent unit frames during battlegrounds. However its primary function
is to alter player names in Cyrillic and other multibyte character sets into names readable/callable
by players who would not otherwise be able to read or even pronounce anything similar to these names.
We believe that in any PVP encounter, and specifically in Rated Battlegrounds, the ability to target
call can easily be the difference between victory and defeat.

This alteration is PURELY COSMETIC and does not interfere with the experience in any way.

No disrespect is meant to those whose names are being changed, we are simply attempting to level the
playing field. This has been an issue for any serious PVP player since the European and Russian
servers were combined. Just watch the stats after this goes live.

Note that the Objectives Frame will be hidden while MrT is active.
To move MrT around the screen simply right click and drag anywhere on the frame.

Please send any feedback to mrtarget@lockofwar.com, constructive criticism is appreciated.
